# Bus Route Allocation System

##### SE Project Synopsis

This system is designed to allocate routes to students signing up for the college bus service. The aim of this project is to minimize the time and cost taken for students to travel to-and-fro their homes and college. 

The program will take in the location of all the students homes and the location of the college and the capacity of the buses as inputs. It will then cluster the students living in a pre-defined radius into a single node. It will then find the most efficient way it can to create and assign bus routes to bring the students to college to minimize the time travelled by the bus and maximize the number of students in a bus (within the bus capacity).

This information is then stored in a database. Whenever new students are added, the routes are adjusted accordingly.
