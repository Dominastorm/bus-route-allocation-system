# College Bus Route Planner

This is a program that takes creates and allocates bus routes to students using Graph Theory. When students sign up for the bus service, the data about the number of students living in different areas, the time taken to go along a particular road, the number of students that can be accommodated on a bus are all taken as parameters in a graph and solved to get create routes and assign buses to students. This information is then stored in a database. Whenever new students are added, the routes are adjusted accordingly.
